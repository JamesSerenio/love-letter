            <h1>Hi, Palangga</h1>
            <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to extend my sincerest apologies for everything that has happened between us recently. I realize that my actions and words may have caused you hurt, frustration, or confusion, and for that, I am truly sorry.

                I want to acknowledge the impact of my behavior and take full responsibility for any pain or discomfort I may have caused. It was never my intention to make you feel this way, and I deeply regret any part I played in creating a difficult situation between us.
                
                Please know that I value our relationship and the connection we share. I am committed to making amends and working towards a resolution that is mutually respectful and understanding. Your feelings and perspective are important to me, and I am open to hearing your thoughts and concerns whenever you are ready to discuss them.
                
                Once again, I apologize for everything, and I hope we can find a way to move forward positively from this point onward.</p>
